Based on the notion of primitive function, we have built an integrated computer system, which generates an elegant and simple environment, capable of representing statements and proofs in an absolutely precise way.

We have used logical operators, predefined or user-defined, which are primitive functions whose arguments and results are forms or terms. By composing such logical operators, we can generate any statement.

We have encapsulated the notions of logic in our inference operators, which are used to generate the proofs of the theorems. The system allows us to generate only correct statements, and theorem proofs become calls of inference operators. The proofs, although in principle similar to traditional demonstrations, are absolutely rigorous.

Sentences are obtained by composing logical operators, so they can be represented as trees, with the arguments of each logical operator highlighted. This representation allows us to make global visual assessments and comparisons of the statements. It should be noted that the statements can be easily translated into traditional form.
