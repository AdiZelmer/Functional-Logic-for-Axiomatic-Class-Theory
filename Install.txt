"Logic" is designed to work on a computer network.
To install "Logic", you have to perform 3 steps. The first two points must be performed on the server. The third point must be performed on all workstations. If you want to work with "Logic" on a single computer, you perform all three points on this computer.

1.	Installation and configuration of the Firebird service
==============================================================
If you already have the "Firebird-2.5.3" installed on the server and you know the password for the "sysdba" user, then go directly to point 1b (configuration). If not, then choose a server on which you do not have "Firebird" installed and start installing the program (point 1a).

a) Installation
Double-click the program "Firebird-2.5.3.26780_0_Win32.exe" to start the installation. Confirm that you agree for this program to make changes in the operating system. Also confirm that you agree with the terms of use. It is important to leave all the installation options as they are presented, that is, not to make any changes. After confirming all the questions, the program will install Firebird on this computer.

Name <Firebird> the installation folder. It could be something like this:
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Firebird\Firebird_2_5
Confirm:
- I accept the agreement
- Server components
- Super Server binary
- Developer and admin tools components
- Use the Guardian to control the server
- Run as a Service
- Start Firebird automatically everytime you boot up
- Install Control Panel Applet
- Generate client library
- Start Firebird now

Start the service "Firebird", or restart the computer.

b) Configuration
Start Windows command prompt, where you enter the command:
	"<Firebird>\bin\gsec.exe" -user sysdba -password masterkey

where <Firebird> is the installation location of Firebird. If Firebird was installed earlier, instead of the "masterkey" password, use the password required for the "sysdba" user.

If everything worked correctly, you get the prompt:
	GSEC>
Through the following two commands, you define a new user (AZ) required for the "Logic" system:
	GSEC> add AZ -pw servus
	GSEC> quit
Firebird is now installed and configured!

2.	Installation of the database Logic.fdb
==============================================
Extract the file "Logic.bak" from the file "Logic.zip".
Copy the file "Logic.bak" to a location on the server, for example to "D:\Logic\Database". Let us name this location <Database>.
Start Windows command prompt, where you enter the command:
	"<Firebird>\bin\gbak.exe" -c -p 4096 -user AZ -password servus <Database>\Logic.bak <Database>\Logic.fdb

where <Firebird> is the installation location of Firebird.
If the command is written correctly, wait for the prompt to reappear. The gbak program will take a few minutes to create the file Logic.fdb, which is the database. 

3.	Installation of the program Logic.exe
=============================================
The file Logic.con is a text document. Open it with Editor (not with Word!).  The content of the file looks something like this:
	[Connection]
	Server=MyServer
	Path=MyPath

Instead of MyServer, put the name or the IP-Adress of the server. Instead of MyPath, put
<Database>\Logic.fdb

where <Database> is the location of the database on the server. Finally, the file Logic.con should look something like this:
	[Connection]
	Server=ServerName
	Path= D:\Logic\Database\Logic.fdb
or
	[Connection]
	Server=192.168.1.160
	Path= D:\Logic\Database\Logic.fdb

If you install "Logic" on a single computer, then in the file "Logic.con" you can use the name "localhost" instead of the server name:
	[Connection]
	Server=localhost
	Path= D:\Logic\Database\Logic.fdb
Save this file.

Copy the files:
	Logic.con
	Logic.exe
	fbclient.dll
to a folder.
Start the program “Logic.exe” from this folder.
